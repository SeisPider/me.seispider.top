**Xiao Xiao** is a PhD candidate in Geophysics at
[University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/),
supervised by Prof. Lianxing Wen.

His research is directed toward understanding the Earth's structure in the crust and upper mantle with seismological tools (e.g., seismic tomography and receiver function analysis).
