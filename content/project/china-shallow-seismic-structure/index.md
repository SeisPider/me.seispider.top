title: China Shallow Seismic Structure
summary: |
  Goal of this project are two folds: 1) understanding the compositional and thermal states of bedrocks in the upper crust of the Contiental China and 2) constructing a reference shallow seismic model for future studies of imaging deeper seismic structure.
