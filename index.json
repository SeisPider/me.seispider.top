Application of the method in the North South Seismic Belt region in China results in high-resolution Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps and accurate earthquake centroid parameters. The additional earthquake data notably improve resolution of the inverted phase velocity model in west Yunnan and central Tibetan blocks, the regions with sparse seismic station coverage. The inverted phase velocity model exhibits high-velocity anomalies in cratonic regions and the Emeishan Large Igneous Province, and low-velocity anomalies in the interior and surrounding regions of the Tibetan Plateau. Relocation places earthquakes in shallow depths with geotherm above the crustal rock’s brittle-ductile transition temperature of ~400℃, revealing thermal control on thickness of the seismogenic zone. With earthquake centroid parameters constrained, earthquake data are expected to provide further constraints on the deep seismic structure that is beyond the sampling limit of seismic ambient noise.\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"6ae24b8e1c38952363b56b47fb97de32","permalink":"https://me.seispider.info/project/simulataneous-inversion-phase-velocity-and-source/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/simulataneous-inversion-phase-velocity-and-source/","section":"project","summary":"Our goals are two folds: 1) to develop and test a strategy of combining seismic ambient noise and regional earthquake surface wave data in constraining seismic structure of the Earth and 2) to provide high-resolution phase velocity maps and earthquake centroid parameters in the North South Seismic Belt region in the continental China and gain insights on evolutional histories of the region. \n","tags":["Seismic Imaging Method"],"title":"Simultaneous inversion for surface wave phase velocity and earthquake centroid parameters","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Shallow 3D shear wave velocity model of the uppermost crust beneath the continental China  Shallow 3D shear wave velocity model beneath the continental China  In this study, we construct a high-resolution shallow three-dimensional (3D) seismic model in the top 10 km of the upper crust in the continental China, with constraints of P polarization, Rayleigh wave ellipticity and receiver function obtained from records of 3848 seismic stations.
